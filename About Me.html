  <p><h2> I'm currently taking Web Development to learn Web Programming! </h2></p>


  <div class="first"> <p> I'm a Mercy college Alumi with Bachelors Degree in computer design.  After graduating from college I found a job at a
    Home Automation Company for their graphic design department. At my job I help design icons for our remote control user interfaces. After 3 years at my
    current position I started to feel unfulfilled, I wasn't learning anything new and it became routine. The skills I have are outdated since my current job
    is not using modern software which has hindered my learning process.
    So this past summer, I took the challenge and took the <em>UI/UX design course at NYCDA</em>. This was the best decision I ever made, I learned so much and feel
    this is what I needed to refresh my skills. Right now I am taking the Web Development course at NYCDA its a bit challenging for me,
    but I hope to learn all I can to create websites.</p> </div>


          <div class="second"><strong>I also wouldn't mind to find a career in Web Development either!</strong>
          </div>
          <br>

          <div class ="third"> When I am not pushing pixels you will find me listening to music, playing on my drums and spending quality time with family.
