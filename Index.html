  <div class="content"> I'm a Mercy college Alumi with Bachelors Degree in computer design.  After graduating from college I found a job at a
  Home Automation Company for their graphic design department. At my job I help design icons for our remote control user interfaces. After 3 years at my
  current position I started to feel unfulfilled, I wasn't learning anything new and it became routine. The skills I have are outdated since my current job
  is not using modern software which has hindered my learning process.
  So this past summer, I took the challenge and took the <em>UI/UX design course at NYCDA</em>. This was the best decision I ever made, I learned so much and feel
  this is what I needed to refresh my skills. Right now I am taking the Web Development course at NYCDA its a bit challenging for me,
  but I hope to learn all I can to create websites. <strong><em> I also wouldn't mind to find a career in Web Development either!</strong></em>
